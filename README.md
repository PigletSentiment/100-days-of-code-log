## 1. Ethereum Developer Course

### Day 6: June 6, 2021
**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- After creating a support ticket with the BTA, I discovered that I can just go ahead with the labs on my own.
- Created the first Solidy code using remix.  Following is my first code
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-By-1.0
// Creative Commons Attribution 1.0 Generic

pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract Album {
string public artist;
string public albumTitle;
uint public tracks;
string public constant contractAuthor = 'Andrew Park';

    constructor() {
        artist = 'Nirvana';
        albumTitle = 'Nevermind';
        tracks = 13;
    }
} // Album
```

- In addition to the Solidity code, I have been reading up on the following
  - https://bitsonblocks.net/2016/10/02/gentle-introduction-ethereum/
  - https://bitsonblocks.net/2015/09/01/gentle-introduction-bitcoin/
  - https://bitsonblocks.net/2015/09/09/gentle-introduction-blockchain-technology/
- The last two are recommended pre-readings for the first one.ddi




### Day 5: June 5, 2021
**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- Learn about the truffle frameworks https://www.trufflesuite.com/
- the framework is really for smart contract development and testing
- it offers unit testing feature where the syntax resembles mochachai
- A couple of resources that can help
  - Truffles petshop (step by step guide to setting up and run project - tutorial)
  - truffle boxes - mostly templates
- Additional reading I must complete
  - https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/
  - https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/
  - https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/
  - https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/
  - https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/
- I am getting closer to lab time .. but not yet, it seems ...

### Day 4: June 4, 2021
**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- Since I am not getting much out of the lectiures of BTA's course (this guy just talks - not much visuals, not much demos, just talks...) I have done some Googling to make more sense of lectures.
- I wanted to see the internals of an Ethereum block, I found some resources from ethereum.org
  
  https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/
  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8&t=15s

  These were much more useful than the talkative and not so productive BTA course.
- **Still hoping to get to the coding or building portion of the course**
- **Is this guy for real?? Kris Bennett - Chief Learning Officer has been talking over 50% of the course.  He keeps on saying it'll make more sense when we get into the labs but WHEN???! if we are not getting into it any time soon just don't say it!  I am getting so update listening to this guy talk for hours**

### Day 3: June 3, 2021
**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- Learned that one of the most considerations for blockchain design is
  - Public or Private
  - Open or Closed
  - permissioned or permissionless?
- uses cases for Hyperledger vs Ethereum
- the instructor touched on the Ethereum tooling infrastructure
  - I need to be connected to a node to access the rest of nodes
  - I can run my own local node https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/
  - or I can connect to an externally hosted node such as infura https://nimbus.guide/infura-guide.html
    
 
- **Hoping to get to the coding or building portion of the course**
- **The instructor of the on-demand course keeps talking about the lab and the hands-on portion of the course but after 41% of the court, I still don't even see the sections**

### Day 2: June 2, 2021
**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- Ether source code repos: https://github.com/ethereum
- Ethereum network
  - Live network (main net) == ID 1
  - Test net = ID 2 (retired) and 3 and 4 (Rinkeby)
  - Beyond 4 is ... private instances of ethereum
    - assigned

- **Hoping to get to the coding or building portion of the course**
- **Also hoping to write and pass the certificate exam at the end of the course**

### Day 1: June 1, 2021

**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- Complete the intro and chapter 1 (Blockchain basics)
I will upload code as soon as exercises are introduced.  Until then I will create the summary of the lecture.
Today was just an introduction to Blockchain - what is it, when did it start and the origin.
