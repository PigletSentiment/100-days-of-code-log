## 1. Ethereum Developer Course

### Day 3: June 3, 2021
**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- Learned that one of the most considerations for blockchain design is
  - Public or Private
  - Open or Closed
  - permissioned or permissionless?
- uses cases for Hyperledger vs Ethereum
- the instructor touched on the Ethereum tooling infrastructure
  - I need to be connected to a node to access the rest of nodes
  - I can run my own local node https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/
  - or I can connect to an externally hosted node such as infura https://nimbus.guide/infura-guide.html
    
 
- **Hoping to get to the coding or building portion of the course**
- **The instructor of the on-demand course keeps talking about the lab and the hands-on portion of the course but after 41% of the court, I still don't even see the sections**

### Day 2: June 2, 2021
**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- Ether source code repos: https://github.com/ethereum
- Ethereum network
  - Live network (main net) == ID 1
  - Test net = ID 2 (retired) and 3 and 4 (Rinkeby)
  - Beyond 4 is ... private instances of ethereum
    - assigned

- **Hoping to get to the coding or building portion of the course**
- **Also hoping to write and pass the certificate exam at the end of the course**

### Day 1: June 1, 2021

**Today's Learning:**

- BTA's [Ethereum Developer Training on demand](https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/ethereum-developer-training-on-demand) course

**Progress:**
- Complete the intro and chapter 1 (Blockchain basics)
I will upload code as soon as exercises are introduced.  Until then I will create the summary of the lecture.
Today was just an introduction to Blockchain - what is it, when did it start and the origin.
